#Design Decisions
<h3>Task runners</h3>
I decided not to use Grunt because although it would provide a better http
response from the server,<br> there doesn't seem to be enough benefit to add the boilerplate to this project.
<h3>Classes and ID's</h3>
In the HTML I use a mix of classes and id's.  I tried to use id's for individual elements with more than 2 style attributes.<br>
Classes were used for elements that would be used more than once.
<h3>DOM Manipulation</h3>
JQuery is a very powerful resource, but was only used sparingly in this project since AngularJS has many options built-in for DOM manipulation.
